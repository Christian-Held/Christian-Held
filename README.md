👋 Hi, I’m Christian Held

💻 Senior Software Engineer | Full-Stack Developer | AI Enthusiast

I’m passionate about building robust, scalable, and innovative applications – from backend services to intelligent systems powered by AI. With more than 15 years of professional experience in software development (Java, Spring Boot, enterprise applications, distributed systems), I recently focused on cloud-native architectures, Kubernetes, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to stay at the cutting edge.

🚀 About Me

🎯 Full-Stack Engineer with strong backend focus (Java, Spring Boot, Jakarta EE) and frontend skills (React, Angular).

🤖 Exploring AI/ML & LLMs with hands-on projects around RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), vector databases, and secure local deployments.

☁️ Building cloud-native solutions with Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS.

🏗️ Transitioning from enterprise monoliths to modern microservices & event-driven architectures (Kafka).

📚 Actively learning and experimenting with cutting-edge tools through projects, courses, and certifications.

🌱 Currently Working On

Backend Development: Robust microservices using Spring Boot & Jakarta EE.

Frontend Development: Learning Angular to deliver modern, interactive UIs.

AI Prototyping: Building solutions with open-source LLMs, embeddings, and RAG.

DevOps & Cloud: Kubernetes clusters, container orchestration, and AWS services.

👀 Interests

🧩 Designing end-to-end software solutions that solve real-world problems.

⚡ Exploring Generative AI for business and productivity tools.

🔄 Applying event-driven architectures with Kafka for resilient systems.

🏗️ Improving skills in software architecture (CPSA-FL certification in progress).

💞️ Collaboration

I’m open to collaborating on:

🌍 Open-source projects (Java, Spring Boot, AI/ML, DevOps).

📱 Tools & apps that simplify everyday tasks.

🤝 Research or proof-of-concept projects involving AI in real-world domains (finance, healthcare, automation).
